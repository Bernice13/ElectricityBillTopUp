Hints
Use a persistent storage type (most likely Text file or Json File) as your database
Create a Library and Two Console Applications (one for the agent and one for the customer) 
The Two Console Applications  should be serviced from the common Library. Ie (add a reference to the Library project inside both console apps)
The Library should be smart enough to separate namespaces that are only peculiar to the Customer application or to the Agent Application.
-Only the Library should be able to read/write to the database. The service layers can also stay inside the Library project (as namespaces)
Your program should be interactive.
When you want to run your program, to run the customer app, just change your starting point to the program.cs file of the customer console app,
Alternatively when you want to run the Agent Application, change your starting point to the Program.cs file for  the Agent app
